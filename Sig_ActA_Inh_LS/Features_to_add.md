1. Code configuration files to deal with the plaethora of options.
2. New methods
    1. nearest level rather than fixed intervals for levels. This might basically bias the system largely towards the extremes (since they have a larger range : from 1 to inf or -inf to -1.). But, that is if all values in the number line have equal chance of getting picked. 
    2. Multilevel nIsing formalism : 0, 0.5, 1 instead of -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1
3. Partial turn-off and partial multilevel
4. State transition graph
