	abstract = {Injury induces retinal Müller glia of certain cold-blooded vertebrates, but not those of mammals, to regenerate neurons. To identify gene regulatory networks that reprogram Müller glia into progenitor cells, we profiled changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in Müller glia from zebrafish, chick, and mice in response to different stimuli. We identified evolutionarily conserved and species-specific gene networks controlling glial quiescence, reactivity, and neurogenesis. In zebrafish and chick, the transition from quiescence to reactivity is essential for retinal regeneration, whereas in mice, a dedicated network suppresses neurogenic competence and restores quiescence. Disruption of nuclear factor I transcription factors, which maintain and restore quiescence, induces Müller glia to proliferate and generate neurons in adult mice after injury. These findings may aid in designing therapies to restore retinal neurons lost to degenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Identifying the design principles of complex regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making remains essential to decode embryonic development as well as enhance cellular reprogramming. A well-studied network motif involved in cellular decision-making is a toggle switch—a set of two opposing transcription factors A and B, each of which is a master regulator of a specific cell fate and can inhibit the activity of the other. A toggle switch can lead to two possible states—(high A, low B) and (low A, high B)—and drives the ‘either-or' choice between these two cell fates for a common progenitor cell. However, the principles of coupled toggle switches remain unclear. Here, we investigate the dynamics of three master regulators A, B and C inhibiting each other, thus forming three-coupled toggle switches to form a toggle triad. Our simulations show that this toggle triad can lead to co-existence of cells into three differentiated ‘single positive' phenotypes—(high A, low B, low C), (low A, high B, low C) and (low A, low B, high C). Moreover, the hybrid or ‘double positive' phenotypes—(high A, high B, low C), (low A, high B, high C) and (high A, low B, high C)—can coexist together with ‘single positive' phenotypes. Including self-activation loops on A, B and C can increase the frequency of ‘double positive' states. Finally, we apply our results to understand cellular decision-making in terms of differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th2 and Th17 states, where hybrid Th1/Th2 and hybrid Th1/Th17 cells have been reported in addition to the Th1, Th2 and Th17 ones. Our results offer novel insights into the design principles of a multi-stable network topology and provide a framework for synthetic biology to design tristable systems.},

Positive feedback loops constituting one or two nodes - self-activation, toggle switch, and double activation loops - are the commonly observed motifs in regulatory networks underlying cell-fate decision systems. Their individual dynamics are well studied; they are capable of exhibiting bistability. However, studies across various biological systems suggest that such positive feedback loops are interconnected with one another, and design principles of coupled bistable motifs remain unclear. What happens to the bistability or multistability traits and the phenotypic space (collection of phenotypes exhibited by a system) due to the couplings? In this study, we explore a set of such interactions using discrete and continuous simulation methods. Our results suggest that the most frequent states in coupled networks follow the 'rules' within a motif (double activation, toggle switch) and those across the two motifs in terms of how the two motifs have been coupled. Moreover, 'hybrid' states can be observed, too, where one of the above-mentioned 'rules' can be compromised, leading to a more diverse phenotypic repertoire. Furthermore, adding direct and indirect selfactivations to these coupled networks can increase the frequency of multistability. Thus, our observations revealed specific dynamical traits exhibited by various coupled bistable motifs.},

	abstract = {Background
Cellular differentiation during development is controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This complex process is always subject to gene expression noise. There is evidence suggesting that commonly seen patterns in GRNs, referred to as biological multistable switches, play an important role in creating the structure of lineage trees by providing stability to cell types.

Results
To explore this question a new methodology is developed and applied to study (a) the multistable switch-containing GRN for hematopoiesis and (b) a large set of random boolean networks (RBNs) in which multistable switches were embedded systematically. In this work, each network attractor is taken to represent a distinct cell type. The GRNs were seeded with one or two identical copies of each multistable switch and the effect of these additions on two key aspects of network dynamics was assessed. These properties are the barrier to movement between pairs of attractors (separation) and the degree to which one direction of movement between attractor pairs is favored over another (directionality). Both of these properties are instrumental in shaping the structure of lineage trees. We found that adding one multistable switch of any type had a modest effect on increasing the proportion of well-separated attractor pairs. Adding two identical switches of any type had a much stronger effect in increasing the proportion of well-separated attractors. Similarly, there was an increase in the frequency of directional transitions between attractor pairs when two identical multistable switches were added to GRNs. This effect on directionality was not observed when only one multistable switch was added.

Conclusions
This work provides evidence that the occurrence of multistable switches in networks that control cellular differentiation contributes to the structure of lineage trees and to the stabilization of cell types.},

	abstract = {The generation of cellular diversity during development involves differentiating cells transitioning between discrete cell states. In the 1940s, the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington introduced a landscape metaphor to describe this process. The developmental path of a cell was pictured as a ball rolling through a terrain of branching valleys with cell fate decisions represented by the branch points at which the ball decides between one of two available valleys. Here we discuss progress in constructing quantitative dynamical models inspired by this view of cellular differentiation. We describe a framework based on catastrophe theory and dynamical systems methods that provides the foundations for quantitative geometric models of cellular differentiation. These models can be fit to experimental data and used to make quantitative predictions about cellular differentiation. The theory indicates that cell fate decisions can be described by a small number of decision structures, such that there are only two distinct ways in which cells make a binary choice between one of two fates. We discuss the biological relevance of these mechanisms and suggest the approach is broadly applicable for the quantitative analysis of differentiation dynamics and for determining principles of developmental decisions.},

In the past few years, a general principle has emerged in which small gene circuits of cross-inhibition and self-activation govern the decision at branch points of cell development.

Whether, and how, cells make use of the coexistence of a larger number of stable states (multistability) is however largely unknown. Here, we first examine how autoregulation, a common attribute of genetic master regulators, facilitates multistability in two-component circuits. A systematic exploration of these modules' parameter space reveals two classes of molecular switches, involving transitions in bistable (progression switches) or multistable (decision switches) regimes. We demonstrate the potential of decision switches for multifaceted stimulus processing, including strength, duration, and flexible discrimination. These tasks enhance response specificity, help to store short-term memories of recent signaling events, stabilize transient gene expression, and enable stochastic fate commitment. The relevance of these circuits is further supported by biological data, because we find them in numerous developmental scenarios. Indeed, many of the presented information-processing features of decision switches could ultimately demonstrate a more flexible control of epigenetic differentiation.},

	abstract = {Bistability arises within a wide range of biological systems from the λ phage switch in bacteria to cellular signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells. Changes in regulatory mechanisms may result in genetic switching in a bistable system. Recently, more and more experimental evidence in the form of bimodal population distributions indicates that noise plays a very important role in the switching of bistable systems. Although deterministic models have been used for studying the existence of bistability properties under various system conditions, these models cannot realize cell-to-cell fluctuations in genetic switching. However, there is a lag in the development of stochastic models for studying the impact of noise in bistable systems because of the lack of detailed knowledge of biochemical reactions, kinetic rates, and molecular numbers. In this work, we develop a previously undescribed general technique for developing quantitative stochastic models for large-scale genetic regulatory networks by introducing Poisson random variables into deterministic models described by ordinary differential equations. Two stochastic models have been proposed for the genetic toggle switch interfaced with either the SOS signaling pathway or a quorum-sensing signaling pathway, and we have successfully realized experimental results showing bimodal population distributions. Because the introduced stochastic models are based on widely used ordinary differential equation models, the success of this work suggests that this approach is a very promising one for studying noise in large-scale genetic regulatory networks.},

However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components.

The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold.

	abstract = {How a cell changes from one stable phenotype to another one is a fundamental problem in developmental and cell biology. Mathematically, a stable phenotype corresponds to a stable attractor in a generally multi-dimensional state space, which needs to be destabilized so the cell relaxes to a new attractor. Two basic mechanisms for destabilizing a stable fixed point, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, have been extensively studied theoretically; however, direct experimental investigation at the single-cell level remains scarce. Here, we performed live cell imaging studies and analyses in the framework of dynamical systems theories on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While some mechanistic details remain controversial, EMT is a cell phenotypic transition (CPT) process central to development and pathology. Through time-lapse imaging we recorded single cell trajectories of human A549/Vim-RFP cells undergoing EMT induced by different concentrations of exogenous TGF-β in a multi-dimensional cell feature space. The trajectories clustered into two distinct groups, indicating that the transition dynamics proceeds through parallel paths. We then reconstructed the reaction coordinates and the corresponding quasi-potentials from the trajectories. The potentials revealed a plausible mechanism for the emergence of the two paths where the original stable epithelial attractor collides with two saddle points sequentially with increased TGF-β concentration, and relaxes to a new one. Functionally, the directional saddle-node bifurcation ensures a CPT proceeds towards a specific cell type, as a mechanistic realization of the canalization idea proposed by Waddington.},

We study the dynamics of the system using numerical simulations, computational bifurcation analysis and mathematical analysis. We find Hopf bifurcations leading to stable and unstable rotation in the system, and we study the rotational behavior as a function of cyclic mutual repression parameter asymmetry between each gene pair in the network. We focus on how rotation co-exists with a stable heteroclinic flow linking the three saddles in the system. We find that this coexistence allows for a transition between two markedly different types of rotation leading to strikingly different phenotypes. One type of rotation belongs to Hopf-induced rotation while the other type, belongs to heteroclinic cycling between three saddle nodes in the system.

	abstract = {Biomolecular networks have to perform their functions robustly. A robust function may have preferences in the topological structures of the underlying network. We carried out an exhaustive computational analysis on network topologies in relation to a patterning function in Drosophila embryogenesis. We found that whereas the vast majority of topologies can either not perform the required function or only do so very fragilely, a small fraction of topologies emerges as particularly robust for the function. The topology adopted by Drosophila, that of the segment polarity network, is a top ranking one among all topologies with no direct autoregulation. Furthermore, we found that all robust topologies are modular?each being a combination of three kinds of modules. These modules can be traced back to three subfunctions of the patterning function, and their combinations provide a combinatorial variability for the robust topologies. Our results suggest that the requirement of functional robustness drastically reduces the choices of viable topology to a limited set of modular combinations among which nature optimizes its choice under evolutionary and other biological constraints.},

	abstract = {Progress in cell type reprogramming has revived the interest in Waddington’s concept of the epigenetic landscape. Recently researchers developed the quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington’s landscape. The Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development. We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics of pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes' influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational design of cell reprogramming protocols.},

Despite being complex, these regulatory networks often only give rise to a few phenotypes. Previously, we identified two ‘teams’ of nodes in a small cell lung cancer regulatory network that constrained the phenotypic repertoire and aligned strongly with the dominant phenotypes obtained from network simulations (Chauhan et al., 2021). However, it remained elusive whether these ‘teams’ exist in other networks, and how do they shape the phenotypic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that five different networks of varying sizes governing epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity comprised of two ‘teams’ of players – one comprised of canonical drivers of epithelial phenotype and the other containing the mesenchymal inducers. These ‘teams’ are specific to the topology of these regulatory networks and orchestrate a bimodal phenotypic landscape with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes being more frequent and dynamically robust to perturbations, relative to the intermediary/hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal ones. Our analysis reveals that network topology alone can contain information about corresponding phenotypic distributions, thus obviating the need to simulate them. We propose ‘teams’ of nodes as a network design principle that can drive cell-fate canalization in diverse decision-making processes.},

We combined principled statistical methods with a framework based on catastrophe theory and approximate Bayesian computation to formulate a quantitative dynamical landscape that accurately predicts cell fate outcomes of pluripotent stem cells exposed to different combinations of signaling factors. Analysis of the landscape revealed two distinct ways in which cells make a binary choice between one of two fates. We suggest that these represent archetypal designs for developmental decisions.

	abstract = {The process controlling the diferentiation of stem, or progenitor, cells into one specific functional direction is called lineage specification. An important characteristic of this process is the multi-lineage priming, which requires the simultaneous expression of lineage-specific genes. Prior to commitment to a certain lineage, it has been observed that these genes exhibit intermediate values of their expression levels. Multi-lineage differentiation has been reported for various progenitor cells, and it has been explained through the bifurcation of a metastable state. During the differentiation process the dynamics of the core regulatory network follows a bifurcation, where the metastable state, corresponding to the progenitor cell, is destabilized and the system is forced to choose between the possible developmental alternatives. While this approach gives a reasonable interpretation of the cell fate decision process, it fails to explain the multi-lineage priming characteristic. Here, we describe a new multi-dimensional switch-like model that captures both the process of cell fate decision and the phenomenon of multi-lineage priming. We show that in the symmetrical interaction case, the system exhibits a new type of degenerate bifurcation, characterized by a critical hyperplane, containing an infinite number of critical steady states. This critical hyperplane may be interpreted as the support for the multi-lineage priming states of the progenitor. Also, the cell fate decision (the multi-stability and switching behavior) can be explained by a symmetry breaking in the parameter space of this critical hyperplane. These analytical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations of the corresponding chemical master equations.},

Here, we investigate a regulatory network underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease with no molecular targeted therapy. Discrete and continuous dynamical simulations of this network reveal its multistable behavior that can explain co-existence of four experimentally observed phenotypes. Analysis of the network topology uncovers that multistability emerges from two teams of players that mutually inhibit each other, but members of a team activate one another, forming a ‘toggle switch’ between the two teams. Deciphering these topological signatures in cancer-related regulatory networks can unravel their ‘latent’ design principles and offer a rational approach to characterize phenotypic heterogeneity in a tumor.},

Each of these phenotypes has a “master regulator”—T-bet (Th1), GATA3 (Th2), and RORγT (Th17)—that inhibits the other two master regulators. Such mutual repression among them at a transcriptional level can enable multistability, giving rise to six experimentally observed phenotype, Th1, Th2, Th17, hybrid Th/Th2, hybrid Th2/Th17, and hybrid Th1/Th17. However, the dynamics of switching among these phenotypes, particularly in the case of epigenetic influence, remain unclear. Here through mathematical modeling, we investigated the coupled transcription-epigenetic dynamics in a three-node mutually repressing network to elucidate how epigenetic changes mediated by any master regulator can influence the transition rates among different cellular phenotypes. We show that the degree of plasticity exhibited by one phenotype depends on relative strength and duration of mutual epigenetic repression mediated among the master regulators in a three-node network. Further, our model predictions can offer putative mechanisms underlying relatively higher plasticity of Th17 phenotype as observed in vitro and in vivo. Together, our modeling framework characterizes phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity as an outcome of emergent dynamics of a three-node regulatory network, such as the one mediated by T-bet/GATA3/RORγT.},

	abstract = {The tendency for cell fate to be robust to most perturbations, yet sensitive to certain perturbations raises intriguing questions about the existence of a key path within the underlying molecular network that critically determines distinct cell fates. Reprogramming and trans-differentiation clearly show examples of cell fate change by regulating only a few or even a single molecular switch. However, it is still unknown how to identify such a switch, called a master regulator, and how cell fate is determined by its regulation. Here, we present CAESAR, a computational framework that can systematically identify master regulators and unravel the resulting canalizing kernel, a key substructure of interconnected feedbacks that is critical for cell fate determination. We demonstrate that CAESAR can successfully predict reprogramming factors for de-differentiation into mouse embryonic stem cells and trans-differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, while unveiling the underlying essential mechanism through the canalizing kernel. CAESAR provides a system-level understanding of how complex molecular networks determine cell fates.},

The regulatory information encompassed in developmental GRNs thus goes far beyond the control of individual genes. We here address regulatory information at different levels of network organization, from single node to subcircuit to large-scale GRNs and discuss how regulatory design features such as network architecture, hierarchical organization, and cis-regulatory logic contribute to the developmental function of network circuits. Using specific subcircuits from the sea urchin endomesoderm GRN, for which both circuit design and biological function have been described, we evaluate by Boolean modeling and in silico perturbations the import of given circuit features on developmental function. The examples include subcircuits encoding positive feedback, mutual repression, and coherent feedforward, as well as signaling interaction circuitry. Within the hierarchy of the endomesoderm GRN, these subcircuits are organized in an intertwined and overlapping manner. Thus, we begin to see how regulatory information encoded at individual nodes is integrated at all levels of network organization to control developmental process.},

Here we globally assess the spatial expression of {\textasciitilde}90\% of expressed transcription factors during sea urchin development from embryo to larva to determine the activity of gene regulatory networks and their regulatory states during cell fate specification. We show that {\textgreater}200 embryonically expressed transcription factors together define {\textgreater}70 cell fates that recapitulate the morphological and functional organization of this organism. Most cell fate-specific regulatory states consist of {\textasciitilde}15–40 transcription factors with similarity particularly among functionally related cell types regardless of developmental origin. Temporally, regulatory states change continuously during development, indicating that progressive changes in regulatory circuit activity determine cell fate specification.

	abstract = {Biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks, possess desirable properties. They are more robust and controllable than random networks. This motivates the search for structural and dynamical features that evolution has incorporated into biological networks. A recent meta-analysis of published, expert-curated Boolean biological network models has revealed several such features, often referred to as design principles. Among others, the biological networks are enriched for certain recurring network motifs, the dynamic update rules are more redundant, more biased, and more canalizing than expected, and the dynamics of biological networks are better approximable by linear and lower-order approximations than those of comparable random networks. Since most of these features are interrelated, it is paramount to disentangle cause and effect, that is, to understand which features evolution actively selects for, and thus truly constitute evolutionary design principles. Here, we compare published Boolean biological network models with different ensembles of null models and show that the abundance of canalization in biological networks can almost completely explain their recently postulated high approximability. Moreover, an analysis of random N–K Kauffman models reveals a strong dependence of approximability on the dynamical robustness of a network.},

In this contribution, we focus on biologically meaningful types of BFs, and perform a systematic study of their preponderance in a compilation of 2,687 functions extracted from published models. A surprising feature is that most of these BFs have odd “bias”, that is they produce “on” outputs for a total number of input combinations that is odd. Upon further analysis, we are able to explain this observation, along with the enrichment of read-once functions (RoFs) and its nested canalyzing functions (NCFs) subset, in terms of 2 complexity measures: Boolean complexity based on string lengths in formal logic, which is yet unexplored in biological contexts, and the so-called average sensitivity. RoFs minimize Boolean complexity and all such functions have odd bias. Furthermore, NCFs minimize not only the Boolean complexity but also the average sensitivity. These results reveal the importance of minimum complexity in the regulatory logic of biological networks.},

	abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) is a cell-fate switching program that enables cells to adopt a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from epithelial (E) to mesenchymal (M) and hybrid E/M states. Hybrid E/M phenotypes are considered optimal for cancer metastasis due to their association with metastatic initiation and traits such as stemness, drug resistance, and collective migration. Boolean models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying EMP have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of E and M phenotypes. However, these models fail to capture hybrid phenotypes effectively, as Boolean frameworks allow only binary gene expression, while hybrid E/M cells exhibit partial expression of both E and M genes. To address this limitation, we modified a threshold-based Boolean formalism to incorporate intermediate gene expression levels. The resulting multilevel model reveals new hybrid steady states with partial expression of both E and M genes, expanding the phenotypic landscape beyond that captured by traditional Boolean models. These hybrid states exhibit lower frustration and higher abundance, indicating enhanced stability. By resolving degeneracy in the dynamics, we further demonstrate that hybrid states identified by the multilevel model are more stable. These findings suggest that adding minimal complexity to Boolean models can uncover previously hidden qualitative features of phenotypic landscapes governed by GRNs.},

Toggle switch – a network of mutually repressive lineage-specific transcription factors A and B – enables two phenotypes from a common progenitor: (high A, low B) and (low A, high B). However, the dynamics of networks enabling differentiation of more than two phenotypes from a progenitor cell has not been well-studied. Here, we investigate the dynamics of a four-node network A, B, C, and D inhibiting each other, forming a toggle tetrahedron. Our simulations show that this network is multistable and predominantly allows for the co-existence of six hybrid phenotypes where two of the nodes are expressed relatively high as compared to the remaining two, for instance (high A, high B, low C, low D). Finally, we apply our results to understand naïve CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subsets, suggesting Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg decision-making to be a two-step process.},

We use a Boolean modeling framework and ideas from the spin glass literature to identify functional differences between five real biological networks and random networks with similar topological features. We show that minimal frustration is a fundamental property that allows biological networks to robustly establish cell types and regulate cell fate choice, and that this property can emerge in complex networks via Darwinian evolution.

Cancer cells use this reversible cellular programming to switch among Epithelial (E), Mesenchymal (M), and hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) state(s) and seed tumors at distant sites. Hybrid E/M cells are often more aggressive and metastatic than the “pure” E and M cells. Thus, identifying mechanisms to inhibit hybrid E/M cells can be promising in curtailing metastasis. While multiple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based mathematical models for EMT/MET have been developed recently, identifying topological signatures enriching hybrid E/M phenotypes remains to be done. Here, we investigate the dynamics of 13 different GRNs and report an interesting association between “hybridness” and the number of negative/positive feedback loops across the networks. While networks having more negative feedback loops favor hybrid phenotype(s), networks having more positive feedback loops (PFLs) or many HiLoops–specific combinations of PFLs, support terminal (E and M) phenotypes. We also establish a connection between “hybridness” and network-frustration by showing that hybrid phenotypes likely result from non-reinforcing interactions among network nodes (genes) and therefore tend to be more frustrated (less stable). Our analysis, thus, identifies network topology-based signatures that can give rise to, as well as prevent, the emergence of hybrid E/M phenotype in GRNs underlying EMP. Our results can have implications in terms of targeting specific interactions in GRNs as a potent way to restrict switching to the hybrid E/M phenotype(s) to curtail metastasis.},

This endeavor is of great importance in advancing targeted therapies and optimizing disease treatment regimens. Based on the bifurcation theory, we conduct a systematic perturbation analysis of the CD4+ T cell regulatory network. Initially, we treat exogenous cytokines as model parameters and conduct single-parameter bifurcation analysis to identify specific exogenous cytokines that can trigger various cell fate transitions. Additionally, based on relevant biological backgrounds, combinatorial perturbation analysis is performed to screen synergistic perturbation combinations. Three distinct types of synergistic combinations are successfully identified. The mechanisms by which different types of combinatorial perturbations exert their effects are also distinct.
